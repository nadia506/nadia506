Hi! I'm Bokyung Nadia Kim, a current Master's student in Engineering Management with a focus on cybersecurity and data science at Johns Hopkins University. During my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, where I dual-majored in Computer Science and Neuroscience, I concentrated on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research and worked as a full-stack software developer. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in machine learning, deep learning, and AI.
